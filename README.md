# Project Outline
Create three unique animated buttons using CSS animations and transitions.

## Design Choices
custom-btn👇🏽
- Changed the text color for all buttons to white

btn-1👇🏽
- Removed the default border
- Added translateY and transition for button hover animation.

btn-2👇🏽
- Removed the default border
- Added scale property so button scales up (grows slightly larger) when hovered over.
- Added a diagonal linear gradient that changes direction when hovered over.

btn-3👇🏽
- Changed the background color to be the same as the body
- Changed the border values
- Added a box-shadow that animates infinitely when hovered over, giving a pulse effect.

## Challenges Faced
- I struggled to understand the ::before & ::after pseudo-elements in the codepen and how everything works together to make the animation possible.
- I struggled to add an ease timing function to the gradient on btn-2 so it switches smoothly.

## Features I Am Proud Of
- I am particularly proud of how I was able to use what I learned in CSS animation up until this point (the keyframes and transition/animation properties).
